# Beatbot

- - -

A limited-functionality front-end for [MPD](http://musicpd.org/). For when you
want to give remote access to your MPD server, but not full control. (There's
other clients for that) Beatbot allows users to see what song is currently
playing, see what songs are coming up soon, and request songs from the current
playlist in MPD.

Because the Python bindings for MPD do not yet handle album art, Beatbot needs
to be installed on the same server as MPD, or to have a copy of the same mp3s
locally.
